# awesome-datasets
Curated datasets for machine learning tasks according to use cases adapted from a [now defunct article on Kaggle](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/541980136382090788/).

For each type of analysis think about:
* What problem does it solve and for who?
* How is it being solved today?
* What are the data inputs and where do they come from?
* What are the outputs and how are they consumed? Online models, static or dynamic reports?
* Is it a revenue leakage (“saves us money”) or a revenue growth (“makes us money”) problem?
